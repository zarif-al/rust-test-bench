Rust Test bench
This is a test bench for trying out stuff with Rust as I am learning the language.

To run the application, please perform the following steps:

- Install Docker Desktop
- Install VSCode and Remote Development extension in VSCode.
- Clone the repository and open with VSCode.
- You should now be able to re-open this repository in a dev container. Hint: Click on the `><` icon at the bottom left.
- In the terminal type `cargo run`
